# AMR_EDA_Iterative_Dashboard

Got a dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on countries, including metrics such as average population, GDP, GDP per capita, health expenditure, adult mortality rate, development level, and crude death rates, categorized by continents. 
Here I create a dashboard to provide an interactive view along with displaying the development level and crude death rates. This enables viewers to explore economic, demographic, and health-related insights easily.
